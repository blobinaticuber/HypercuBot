The 3^4 has 216 stickers
The 3^4 has 8 1c pieces, 24 2c pieces, 32 3c pieces, and 16 4c pieces
The formula to calculate the number of states for the 3x3x3x3 is (24!x32!)&2 x 16!&2 x 2^23 x (3!)^31 x 3 x (4!&2)^15 x 4
3^4 is a shorter way of writing 3x3x3x3
Hyperspeedcube is a very cool program ðŸ˜Ž
Melinda's Physical 2x2x2x2 is a real puzzle that you can play with that works just* like a 2x2x2x2
The 4th dimension in hypercubing programs is represented as inwards vs outwards, due to the projection
Many standard 3x3x3 methods can be scaled up and used on the 3x3x3x3, such as Roux and CFOP
There are 6 platonic solids in 4D: Simplex, Tesseract, 16-cell, 24-cell, 120-cell, 600-cell
During 2022, Grant S made 4 new physical 4D puzzles
During 2022, the 3^4 speedsolving record was lowered by over 6 minutes, thanks to the Hyperspeedcube program's piece filters and keyboard controls
RKT is a technique that lets you manipulate a single cell of the 3^4 like a 3^3
There are theoretical designs for physical simplex, and many types of hypercuboids
In 5D, Double RKT lets you manipulate a side like a cube by using RKT to manipulate that side like a tesseract
The first person in the 2x2x2x2 Hall Of Fame was Bob Hearn
The Hall Of Fame for 3^4 solutions was closed on December 7th, 2022 when it reached 500 entries
